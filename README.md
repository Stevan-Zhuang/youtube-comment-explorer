### About
Given a YouTube link or YouTube video ID, this program analyzes the replies to popular comments and determines if they were made by bot accounts. The program can also process keywords, in which the video returned will be the first video in the search results had the keywords been searched on the actual YouTube website.

Accounts are evaluated to be bots based soley off the number of replies to comments that they make. As a result, the less popular a YouTube video is, the more likely it is for the results to be innaccurate, as bots do not comment often on unpopular videos.
